# Program for athermal quasi-static shear simulations of granular matter

This C library is used to perform athermal quasi-static simulations (shear or compression) of granular matter. The model consists of a number of frictionless spheres interacting through harmonic or hertzian repulsions. The inter-particle potential can be modified for other models. The FIRE algorithm is used for energy minimizations.

The codes were developed by members in Yuliang Jin's group (http://home.itp.ac.cn/~yuliangjin/) at Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Please contact Dr. Deng Pan (dengpan@mail.itp.ac.cn) or Dr. Yuliang Jin (yuliangjin@mail.itp.ac.cn) for further information.
