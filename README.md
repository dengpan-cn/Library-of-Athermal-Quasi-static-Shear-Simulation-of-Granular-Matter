# Program for athermal quasi-static shear simulations of granular matter

This C program can be used to perform athermal quasi-static shear (or compression) simulations of a granular matter model. The model consists of a number of frictionless spheres interacting through harmonic repulsions. The inter-particle potential can be modified for other models. The FIRE algorithm is used for energy minimizations. Several examples are given in the folder "example" to show how to use this program. 

The codes were developed by Yuliang Jin's research group (http://home.itp.ac.cn/~yuliangjin/) at Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Please contact the developers, Dr. Deng Pan (dengpan@mail.itp.ac.cn) or Dr. Yuliang Jin (yuliangjin@mail.itp.ac.cn) for questions.
